# Dice-Game

Hi there everyone and future me to yet another frontend project I've created! :)

In this project I've created a dice game in order to practice some Javascript and DOM manipulation in action! :D

## The way this game works is very easy:
### Step 1:
- Step 1: Download the code and open the index.html file in your browser. Alternatively you can click on this link as this project is also hosted on my GitHub: https://ninjin96.github.io/Dice-Game/
- Step 2: Once you're able see the web page. You can finally settle the battle with your friends or family about who gets the last slice of pizza. Decide a player 1 and player 2.
- Step 3: Click on refresh in your browser. Now the code will run a roll for each dice. The player with the highest roll will win and be displayed on the web page.

Congrats if you won the last slice of pizza!

Thanks for checking out my project and take care!
